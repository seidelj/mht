
function [output] = mhtexp(B,Y,sub,D,combo,select)

% MHTEXP considers the multiple hypothesis testing problem in
% experimental economics described in List, Shaikh, and Xu (2015).
%
%   Denote by n the number of units, by numoc the number of outcomes, by
%   numsub the number of subgroups, and by numpc the number of pairs of
%   treatment (control) groups of interest.
%
%   Among the input arguments of mhtexp: 
%   B is the number of simulated samples (the suggested number is 3000, 
%   but a larger number is recommended when there are a large number of hypotheses);
%   Y is an n by numoc matrix with the ijth element being the jth outcome 
%   of the ith unit;
%   sub is an n by 1 matrix with the ith element being the subgroup ID 
%   of the ith unit, where a subgroup ID is coded as an integer in [1,numsub];
%   D is an n by 1 matrix in which the ith element is the treatment status
%   of the ith unit (the control group is coded as 0);
%   combo is a numpc by 2 matrix, each row of which indicates a pairwise
%   comparison of interest;
%   select is a numoc by numsub by numpc matrix, where the ijkth element 
%   is equal to 1 if we are interested in the hypothesis for the ith outcome, 
%   the jth subgroup, and the kth pairwise comparison, and the ijkth element is 
%   equal to 0 otherwise.
%
%   The output argument "output" is a matrix with 10 columns:
%   columns 1-4 present the id's of the corresponding outcomes, subgroups, 
%   and treatment (control) groups;
%   the 5th column presents the absolute values of difference in sample means;
%   the 6th column presents the p-values based on the single testing procedure 
%   described in Remark 3.1 of List, Shaikh, and Xu (2015);
%   the 7th column presents the p-values based on the multiple testing procedure
%   described in Theorem 3.1 of List, Shaikh, and Xu (2015);
%   the 8th column presents the p-values based on the multiple testing procedure
%   described in Remark 3.7 of List, Shaikh, and Xu (2015);
%   the 9th column presents the p-values based on the Bonferroni method;
%   the 10th column presents the p-values based on the Holm's method.
%   
%   Please refer to List, Shaikh, and Xu (2015) for examples.
