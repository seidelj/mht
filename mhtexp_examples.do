//Example 1: Hypothesis testing with multiple outcomes: 
//  We consider four outcome variables: response rate, dollars given not including
//  match, dollars given including match, and amount change.

//Example 2: Hypothesis testing with multiple subgroups: 
//  We consider four subgroups: red county in a red state, blue county in a red state,
//  red county in a blue state, and blue county in a blue state. We focus on
//  the outcome response rate.
